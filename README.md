## Do I use this?

Not yet, but you can.

## Contributing

## Historical nonsense

I woke up one morning after seeing the traeish of Bojack Horseman and thought:

```thoughts
"what's the worst possible way I can show time on the internet?"
```

That's how [this](http://smaslennikov.com/whattimeisitrightmeow/) came about. But I don't want to have to run it on my own VPS, that's what free Travis is for.

Behold.
